## Durable checkpoint

C8 Core boundaries 1-4 are complete in the local convergence stack.

- PR #178: portable interceptor lowering, merged as `fc6a45fb7905790ea01c947d39af5ab15f02f668`.
- PR #179: production/session discovery and responder authority, merged as `8278036108d48084666ea79a9d506ed681ee15bf` from exact candidate `623ce5f0c577cc8fce7c9bd540077195e88a139e`.

PR #179 exact-head evidence:

- M1 Common Play Interaction workflow `33249665899`: SUCCESS;
- Rules Domain workflow `33249665907`: SUCCESS;
- local focused workflow including the atomic-attack regression: 79/79 passed;
- local TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`: passed;
- PR diff: seven bounded files; mergeability true; boundary-1 ancestry confirmed.

Broad Contract/Resource/Phase/UI reds remain inherited workflow failures and were not required for this boundary. Do not repeat PR #176-#179 validation unless their affected surfaces change.

Boundary 3/4 local evidence:

- authoritative interceptor facts: 26 focused schema/domain/production checks plus 4 connected authority checks passed;
- damage-roll and final acceptance: exact M1 Common Play Interaction 87/87 passed;
- connected/fact/atomic-attack focused regression 45/45 passed;
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` passed.

## Active boundary

C9 pre-entry coverage reconciliation.

Reuse the existing Common Play fact-provider/manual-authority infrastructure. If a required fact is unavailable, apply the authored `unknownPolicy` (`block`, `request-authority`, `treat-false`, or `unsupported`). Never fabricate distance, visibility, cover, hearing, detection, or similar facts. Prove with arbitrary external identities and rename invariance.

## Next Exact Action

Audit the 36-row `v1-mechanism-coverage-ledger.json` against existing deterministic source/tests. Resolve F-M to `IMPLEMENTED` or `PROVEN_UNNEEDED`, promote only fully evidenced rows, and implement the highest-impact actual gap before Gate N. Do not restore global legacy-zero as a blanket prerequisite.

C8 Core is complete locally. C9 is active but Gate N entry is blocked by 36 `INCOMPLETE` ledger rows and F-M `TBD`. Overall verdict: `V1 INCOMPLETE`.
