## Durable checkpoint

C8 Core boundaries 1-4 are complete in the local convergence stack.

- PR #178: portable interceptor lowering, merged as `fc6a45fb7905790ea01c947d39af5ab15f02f668`.
- PR #179: production/session discovery and responder authority, merged as `8278036108d48084666ea79a9d506ed681ee15bf` from exact candidate `623ce5f0c577cc8fce7c9bd540077195e88a139e`.

PR #179 exact-head evidence:

- M1 Common Play Interaction workflow `33249665899`: SUCCESS;
- Rules Domain workflow `33249665907`: SUCCESS;
- local focused workflow including the atomic-attack regression: 79/79 passed;
- local TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`: passed;
- PR diff: seven bounded files; mergeability true; boundary-1 ancestry confirmed.

Broad Contract/Resource/Phase/UI reds remain inherited workflow failures and were not required for this boundary. Do not repeat PR #176-#179 validation unless their affected surfaces change.

Boundary 3/4 local evidence:

- authoritative interceptor facts: 26 focused schema/domain/production checks plus 4 connected authority checks passed;
- damage-roll and final acceptance: exact M1 Common Play Interaction 87/87 passed;
- connected/fact/atomic-attack focused regression 45/45 passed;
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` passed.

## Active boundary

C9 Gate N coverage implementation. The complete 36-row audit is reconciled; every row remains truthfully `INCOMPLETE` until its required semantic/evidence matrix is complete.

Current validated C9 checkpoints:

- `7be5c795`: actor artifact creates/removes typed combatants and projects Scene/Host/Client/expiry/Undo lifecycle;
- `583ff38c`: generic Common Play payments atomically spend Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction with production Undo;
- `281be9b1`: summoned actors project scoped installed Common Play actions and execute them through Host-authoritative connected events with Undo.

Latest proof: TypeScript passed; 46/46 relevant domain/production/connected regressions passed; ledger contracts 2/2 passed; coverage checker reports exactly 36 `INCOMPLETE` rows. Worktree is clean at `281be9b1`.

## Next Exact Action

Preserve and atomically execute the schema-declared `PaymentContract` across non-operation Common Play lowerers (`save-damage`, `effect`, `zone`, and `artifacts`), beginning with a failing arbitrary-identity Action-payment regression and proving production connected convergence plus Undo. Do not promote any ledger row until its full matrix is green.

C8 Core is complete locally. C9 is active and Gate N is blocked by 36 `INCOMPLETE` ledger rows. Overall verdict: `V1 INCOMPLETE`.
