## Durable checkpoint

C8 Core boundaries 1-4 are complete in the local convergence stack.

- PR #178: portable interceptor lowering, merged as `fc6a45fb7905790ea01c947d39af5ab15f02f668`.
- PR #179: production/session discovery and responder authority, merged as `8278036108d48084666ea79a9d506ed681ee15bf` from exact candidate `623ce5f0c577cc8fce7c9bd540077195e88a139e`.

PR #179 exact-head evidence:

- M1 Common Play Interaction workflow `33249665899`: SUCCESS;
- Rules Domain workflow `33249665907`: SUCCESS;
- local focused workflow including the atomic-attack regression: 79/79 passed;
- local TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`: passed;
- PR diff: seven bounded files; mergeability true; boundary-1 ancestry confirmed.

Broad Contract/Resource/Phase/UI reds remain inherited workflow failures and were not required for this boundary. Do not repeat PR #176-#179 validation unless their affected surfaces change.

Boundary 3/4 local evidence:

- authoritative interceptor facts: 26 focused schema/domain/production checks plus 4 connected authority checks passed;
- damage-roll and final acceptance: exact M1 Common Play Interaction 87/87 passed;
- connected/fact/atomic-attack focused regression 45/45 passed;
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` passed.

## Active boundary

C9 Gate N coverage implementation. The complete 36-row audit is reconciled; every row remains truthfully `INCOMPLETE` until its required semantic/evidence matrix is complete.

Current validated C9 checkpoints:

- `7be5c795`: actor artifact creates/removes typed combatants and projects Scene/Host/Client/expiry/Undo lifecycle;
- `583ff38c`: generic Common Play payments atomically spend Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction with production Undo;
- `281be9b1`: summoned actors project scoped installed Common Play actions and execute them through Host-authoritative connected events with Undo.
- `acc46a1a`: schema PaymentContract is preserved and atomically executed across operations, save-damage, effect, zone, and artifact lowerers with production Host/Client convergence and Undo.
- `c87402f9`: canonical stored-invocation artifacts resolve arbitrary installed attack/spell payloads off turn with Reaction, exactly-once consumption, Host/Client event replay, reconnect, and Undo.
- `5308c15e`: movement.relocate executes through the operations lowerer and stored invocation; Ready UI uses the authoritative artifact for installed content; cancel, Undo, and turn-boundary expiry are production-proven.
- `50498ba6`: held-Concentration loss/release/cancel/Undo is production-proven and Family S stored-invocation-ready is promoted to `IMPLEMENTED`.
- `458585cf`: installed damage.taken rules are structurally discovered and appended to the originating Resolver transaction with atomic effect consumption, connected replay/reconnect, and Undo.

Latest proof: TypeScript passed; 14/14 lowered-family production/connected and 6/6 persistent-effect domain regressions passed. Coverage remains truthfully `IMPLEMENTED=1`, `INCOMPLETE=35`; Families N/P gained production evidence but are not promoted beyond their tested event matrix. Code checkpoint is `458585cf`.

## Next Exact Action

Connect canonical Zone membership/event operations to installed production: manual enter/leave plus turn-start/end dispatch must reuse commonPlayZoneRuntime frequency markers, then prove arbitrary identity, duration cleanup, Host/Client replay/reconnect, and Undo. Reconcile Families P/T only to the evidence actually obtained.

C8 Core is complete locally. C9 is active and Gate N is blocked by 36 `INCOMPLETE` ledger rows. Overall verdict: `V1 INCOMPLETE`.
