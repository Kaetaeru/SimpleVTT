## Durable checkpoint

C8 Core boundaries 1-4 are complete in the local convergence stack.

- PR #178: portable interceptor lowering, merged as `fc6a45fb7905790ea01c947d39af5ab15f02f668`.
- PR #179: production/session discovery and responder authority, merged as `8278036108d48084666ea79a9d506ed681ee15bf` from exact candidate `623ce5f0c577cc8fce7c9bd540077195e88a139e`.

PR #179 exact-head evidence:

- M1 Common Play Interaction workflow `33249665899`: SUCCESS;
- Rules Domain workflow `33249665907`: SUCCESS;
- local focused workflow including the atomic-attack regression: 79/79 passed;
- local TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`: passed;
- PR diff: seven bounded files; mergeability true; boundary-1 ancestry confirmed.

Broad Contract/Resource/Phase/UI reds remain inherited workflow failures and were not required for this boundary. Do not repeat PR #176-#179 validation unless their affected surfaces change.

Boundary 3/4 local evidence:

- authoritative interceptor facts: 26 focused schema/domain/production checks plus 4 connected authority checks passed;
- damage-roll and final acceptance: exact M1 Common Play Interaction 87/87 passed;
- connected/fact/atomic-attack focused regression 45/45 passed;
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` passed.

## Active boundary

C9 Gate N coverage implementation. The complete 36-row audit is reconciled; every row remains truthfully `INCOMPLETE` until its required semantic/evidence matrix is complete.

Current validated C9 checkpoints:

- `7be5c795`: actor artifact creates/removes typed combatants and projects Scene/Host/Client/expiry/Undo lifecycle;
- `583ff38c`: generic Common Play payments atomically spend Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction with production Undo;
- `281be9b1`: summoned actors project scoped installed Common Play actions and execute them through Host-authoritative connected events with Undo.
- `acc46a1a`: schema PaymentContract is preserved and atomically executed across operations, save-damage, effect, zone, and artifact lowerers with production Host/Client convergence and Undo.

Latest proof: TypeScript passed; the 4/4 lowerer contract, 5/5 resource/economy, and 6/6 production/connected regressions passed; coverage checker reports exactly 36 `INCOMPLETE` rows. Payment coverage evidence is reconciled without falsely promoting families B or D. Code checkpoint is `acc46a1a`.

## Next Exact Action

Connect the already-implemented generic stored-invocation/Ready domain runtime to the installed Common Play production route using arbitrary identities, then prove capture, trigger, cancel/expiry, Host/Client convergence, persistence, and Undo without selecting the named Ready adapter. Do not promote family S until its full matrix is green.

C8 Core is complete locally. C9 is active and Gate N is blocked by 36 `INCOMPLETE` ledger rows. Overall verdict: `V1 INCOMPLETE`.
